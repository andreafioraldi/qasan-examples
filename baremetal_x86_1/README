Real mode x86 firmware #1
=========================

The allocator is powered by QASan using the x86 backdoor.
See the header for the API.

It can be built with the standard gcc distributed with linux distros but keep in
mind that this is an hack. I you add a lot of code, consider to use a cross
compiler.
