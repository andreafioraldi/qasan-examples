SerenityOS allocator with QASan
===============================

This is the SerenityOs allocator adapted in the same way of the baremetal
example.

Copy kmalloc.cpp into serenity/Kernel/Heap (and maybe before that save the old
kmalloc.cpp) and then follow the build instructions of Serenity.

To run set the SERENITY_QEMU_BIN env var to the path of qasan-qemu-system.
